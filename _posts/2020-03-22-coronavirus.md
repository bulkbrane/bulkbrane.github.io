It seems like all anyone can talk about for the last few weeks is the Coronavirus. Maybe that's not a bad thing. Indeed, the economic impact of the U.S. quarantine will be great, and many small businesses may not live through it.

The duration of the quarantine is not yet known, and neither is the true fatality rate of this novel Coronavirus. With the rapid acceleration of testing, the active case count will doubtlessly increase. This means that we may finally get a more useful fatality rate in the coming weeks or months. In the meantime, the [raw death count](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) is perhaps the most useful number to monitor, because it is less affected by reporting bias.

If there is [more than one type of COVID-19](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036/5775463), the statistics in the U.S. may be quite different than what's been seen in other countries, depending on which types become more prevalent.

Many reputable sites are trying to extrapolate the future based on the limited amount of data available. Here are some examples:

* By mid-May, there will be about 4 million U.S. cases and all open hospital beds in the U.S. will be filled.
* The fatality rate of COVID-19 is between 1% and 3.4%.
* COVID-19 could kill more than 2 million Americans in the coming months.

There are also some articles more skeptical of the current COVID-19 response:

* [A fiasco in the making? As the coronavirus pandemic takes hold, we are making decisions without reliable data](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/)
* [Some Ask a Taboo Question: Is America Overreacting to Coronavirus?](https://www.yahoo.com/news/ask-taboo-america-overreacting-coronavirus-191630253.html)

In any case, it is evident that people feel very strongly about this issue. The general consensus on popular sites like Reddit is that the U.S. is severely under-reacting, and needs to take the virus more seriously. However, we will need to reckon with the societal impact of this unprecedented "shelter-in-place" AKA "stay-at-home" order.

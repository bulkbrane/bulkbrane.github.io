## Summary

Here are some key points I took away from the book.

 - **Talent** requires deep practice, which requires vast amounts of energy.
	 - **Deep practice**: The elite made their achievements through thousands of hours of diligent practice.
	 - **Repetition**: By miniaturizing a game, for example, for more practice can be achieved in a shorter amount of time.
 - **Inspiration** is a vast out-pouring of energy, which can be triggered by combination of the following factors ("primal cues"):
	 - **Scarcity/Exclusivity**: The idea that only a few people can accomplish this feat.
	 - **(Future) Belonging**: Inspirational, relatable figures such as accomplished professionals in a field.
	 - **Perception of self**: Understanding something as a long-term commitment, and seeing yourself becoming a musician, etc. is a powerful effect which can lead to much more effective practice and outcomes.
	 - **Safety**: _"You are not safe"_ _"You're behind â€” keep up!"_

- **Coaching** is invaluable in sustaining skill development. Skills can seldom be acquired by oneself.
	- **Motivational language**: Praise for effort. Instead of "You must be smart at this", say, "You must have worked really hard."
	- **Connection**: Human connection of language, gesture, and emotion.
	- **Cues**: Cues are simple 1-3 word phrases particularly useful for athletes. By issuing these short phrases, coaches can efficiently "push the buttons" of athletes performing maneuvers, movements, etc.

- **Additional Applications**
	- **Parenting**: Teaching kids about the myelin mechanism significantly improved their grades and study habits.
	- **Aging**: Tackling new challenging and forcing oneself to adapt to them increases "cognitive reserve" and decreases risk of dementia.
	- **Business**: "When something goes wrong, ask WHY five times."

To be honest, it's hard to beat [this review of the book on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1eipf7/after_reading_the_latest_entry_in_daniel_coyles/ca0pwqg/), on the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu subreddit of all places.

## Review

I would rate *The Talent Code* three out of five. It's a solid book in the self-help genre, combining scientific topics with inspirational stories and anecdotes.  However, the writing style is a bit gimmicky, constantly referring back to previous passages. Combined with the very loose structure of the book, it definitely fits into the "pop science" genre. Lastly, some of the "scientific" findings seem like little more than unattributed anecdotes.

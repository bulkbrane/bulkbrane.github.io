# Financial Independence

Being financially independent means that we don't need to rely on employment to maintain our lifestyle. How can we become financially independent?

## Live below your means.

This tenet is well-known, but there is some non-obvious wisdom behind it.

We find it easy to justify non-essential purchases here and there, rationalizing them as just "one-time" splurges or as gadgets we "deserve". Indeed, the modern consumerist culture pushes us towards lifestyle inflation, also known as *lifestyle creep*. As we increase our income and wealth, it's very tempting to find ourselves on a *hedonic treadmill*: as our income grows, so do our expenses. Stick to a reasonable budget and [get off the treadmill](https://www.yourmoneyblueprint.co.nz/blog-1/2018/11/22/get-off-the-treadmill).

With each paycheck, *pay yourself* before paying others.

## Plan for the future. Start early.

Humans, compared to other animals, have a unique ability to imagine and visualize future scenarios. Think about it: building a skyscraper requires engineers and architects to design and test their ideas *years* in advance of anything physical being put together. Quite similarly, us as individuals can benefit greatly by taking into consideration our future selves.

The first step is to consider that indeed, even in 10, 20, and 40 years, we will *still* require financial resources to maintain our lifestyle. While we are holding a job, this doesn't seem like a big deal. But, at some point all of us will either *not be able to* work, or *not want to* work. Maybe we want to spend more time with our family. Maybe our employer is going out of business. Or perhaps we just want to have the freedom to pursue more risky business endeavors. Finally, we may want to be able to provide support for our progeny.

Therefore, during our young working years when it seems like almost nothing can go wrong, it is in fact the *best* time to save. We can put away money that we won't need for at least 20-40 years. **Such a long time-horizon gives us enormous power**. When we invest, we no longer need to worry about the relatively brief market dips and spikes. Even if the stock market drops 40% in one year, we can rest assured that the odds are in our favor, that in approximately 20 years our money will quadruple, and **in approximately 40 years our money invested in the stock market will grow more than 16 times**.

Don't take my word for it. The largest mutual funds in the world track the S&P 500, and in the last 40 years that index has grown **30x**. Just one hundred dollars saved today can be $3,000 in the future. And that's not even including the dividends paid out.

## Invest wisely.

To understand *how* to best make our money work for us, we need not look any further than the [Bogleheads investment principles](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy). I cannot emphasize enough that **everyone** should read this wiki page. Unlike the advice you will receive from a wide range of financial institutions, the Bogleheads community of investing enthusiasts is entirely noncommercial, and believes in revolutionary ideas like *minimizing* costs and *maximizing* returns while maintaining acceptable risk.

It seems very unintuitive at first, but the messages we've been bombarded with by the mainstream media and financial marketing agencies really do not have our interests in mind.

TL;DR: Buy and **hold** index funds like [VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX) and [VBTLX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VBTLX).

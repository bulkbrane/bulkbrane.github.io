Top recommended link regarding investing: [Bogleheads investment philosophy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy). The Bogleheads wiki (and forums) are a great resource.

Your portfolio should be diversified in multiple ways, including in risk. Here are a couple of main categories for investments which I'd recommend looking at initially. For each one I have also included the expected annual return on investment.

* Checking account: 0% growth, but can be accessed freely.
* High-yield savings account ([example](https://www.marcus.com/us/en)): currently 1.7% growth, limited to 6 withdrawals per month. Virtually zero risk and FDIC insured.
* US total bond market index ([example](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VBTLX)): currently 3-5% growth, low volatility.
* US total stock market index ([example](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX)): historically 7-10% growth, high volatility.
    * You're probably familiar with the S&P 500, which is an index fund of the 500 largest U.S. companies. The only difference here is that the "total" stock market also includes all the smaller public companies. The S&P 500 makes up about 82% of the total stock market.
    * The Dow Jones is generally considered a flawed index. ([See first paragraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average))

In terms of allocations, a rule of thumb is to invest your age in bonds, and the rest in stocks. Having a greater percentage in bonds helps one stomach the crashes and decreases risk. (See ["efficient frontier"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier).) Ultimately, it really depends on your appetite for volatility. If you don't plan on withdrawing for the next 20+ years, then a mix of 90% in stocks and 10% in bonds would be reasonable. Also, everyone should have 3-6 months of expenses in something much less volatile like a checking account or high-yield savings account.

Based on historical data, the stock market is very low risk if your investment horizon is 10, 20 years or more. From the research of John C. Bogle and others, there are almost no 10-year windows in which you would have lost money in the stock market. However, if you might need the money in 5 years, then the stock market is quite risky because you may lose some money in the short-term.

The way that people who FIRE (financial independence / retire early) take advantage of this is by withdrawing no more than about 3% from their investments per year. Based on various research such as the Trinity study, one would never deplete their portfolio following this strategy. In other words, once you save 33x your annual expenses, you can live off of that indefinitely.

Here's a graph which is dividend-adjusted for the total stock market: [VTI](http://schrts.co/sWrpZZqw). The graphs for DJI and SPY are very similar. Most other charts don't account for dividends, which may be misleading. Vanguard mutual fund and ETF pages also have a little chart showing past performance which is also a useful reference.

As always, there is the caveat that "past performance is not a guarantee of future results". We could always be on the cusp of another Great Depression or unprecedented societal collapse, in which case the historical data would be irrelevant. I guess that's when one [diversifies into survival goods](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/prep/) :)

To touch on why I recommend against picking individual stocks and trying to time the market: It violates some of the wisdom from the Bogleheads investment principles. It introduces more risk, more costs, more taxes, and more complexity. Mathematically it's impossible for most active traders to consistently beat the market. (See John Bogle's writings: [1](http://johncbogle.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/NYU-11-14-07.pdf), [2](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/94cd/de0f3f7d3c67b522ab167456d37c7568ae2b.pdf).) It also opposes the [efficient-market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis).

By the way, if you haven't filed taxes yet, I would highly recommend FreeTaxUSA over its competitors, for many reasons. Try it out! I am not sponsored in any way.
